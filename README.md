# PyBank and PyPoll

Module 3 challenge

## PyBank

In this work, I created a Python script that analyzes the financial records of my company, PyBank.

I used the financial data found in [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/marthagriggs9/python_challenge/blob/main/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) , which contained two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

The Python script analyzed the records to find the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
